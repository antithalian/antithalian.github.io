I've been wanting to do a weekly post about musteloids a la Bruce Schneier's [Friday Squid Blogging](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/01/friday_squid_bl.html). Squid are pretty cool, but I think Musteloidea might be the single most underrated group of mammals. They're carnivorans, and they include just about all of those mammals that you think are pretty cool when you see them but never bother to wonder what they actually are. Wolverines? Musteloids. Red Pandas? Musteloids. Raccoons? Musteloids. There's so many! They're so cool! And they're so cute - look at these!

The goal is going to be to write a semi-informative and hopefully somewhat interesting post on some species/group of musteloids every Monday. We'll see if I can keep up with it. For this week, you're just gonna have to get by with a cute picture of some raccoons. Maybe for next week I'll do raccoons! I always love seeing my friendly neighborhood *procyon lotor*.
